In this work, we extend some results from the Kauffman bracket and HOMFLYPT skein theories to the Kuffman (Dubrovnik) skein theory. In particular, a definition is given for special ``power sum" type elements $\tilde{P}_k$ in the Dubrovnik skein algebra of the annulus $\cd(A)$. It is justified that these elements are the corect generalization for the Chebyshev polynomials (of the first kind) often used when studying Kauffman bracket skein algebras. The $\tilde{P}_k$ are used to give a presentation of the Dubrovnik skein algebra of the torus $\cd(T^2)$, where they are shown to satisfy surprisingly simple relations. This description of $\cd(T^2)$ is in turn used to describe the natural action of this algebra on the skein module of the solid torus. Separate from this, we give strong evidence that the universal character rings for the orthogonal and sympletic Lie groups correspond to the skein algebra $\cd(A)$ in such a way that the Schur functions of type either B, C or D correspond to annular closures $\tilde{Q}_\lambda$ of minimal idempotents of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras $BMW_n$. We also record some miscellaneous formulas, such as a simple central element of $BMW_n$ and commutation relations for the annular closures of BMW symmetrizers $\tilde{Q}_{(n)}$ and their HOMFLYPT counterparts $Q_{(n)}$.
