#DubrovnikSkeinTheory--Thesis

This is my PhD thesis, which I completed under the supervision of Professor Peter Samuelson and defended on the afternoon of June 3rd, 2021.

The final draft can be found in the root folder, as `Thesis.pdf`.

There are many skein-theoretic diagrams found in the `draft` folder in the form of `*.csv` and `*.svg` files. Feel free to use these in any way you want.

There are two different thesis templates in the two specified folders, attached for convenience.
